            Hello! We are so glad you are here and welcome to the Green League! You might be wondering who we are and
            what we believe and we are here to help answer all of your burning questions. The Green League is a
            nonprofit organization first started by our founder, Jonathan Fortreau a couple of years ago to help combat
            the use of fossil fuel use in homes. Having grown up in the home of influential oil barons, Mr. Fortreau has
            worked tirelessly to right the wrongs of his parents and bring about substantial improvements for the
            betterment of humanity and it all starts here with this very organization.
        </p>

            We here at the Green League value our importance to this major cause, and work to instill our five core
            values within our organizationâ€™s members; hard work, community, justice, empathy, and respect. While each of
            these might sound cliche for an organization to stand for, they are taken to heart when it comes to our
            organization. These are the core values that are instilled within every member of our organization, who work
            tirelessly each day to fight this fight against climate change one step at a time. It is only
            through our community, sense of what is right from wrong, feelings for others, and hard work that we can
            truly change the world.

                Originally the Green League was a small group of environmentalists dedicated to preventing climate
                change through petitions and rallies but has since grown to an alliance of ten nonprofit organizations
                working with each other and the local government to change the world for the better. Since our
                inception, we have brought about great change in many ways. Currently, we are working with the IRS to
                provide valuable tax incentives to people if they switch over to renewable energy. In addition, we have
                a dedicated community of lawyers and activists who work to promote our cause in several ways. While our
                lawyers work to lobby and convince various government officials to switch over to renewable energy, our
                activists are sent out to convince various homeowners of the benefits of renewable energy use within the
                world and why we should make the switch. And although we are a large organization, we are always looking
                toward the future and hope to expand our organization internationally across the globe.
